    <h1>REVIEW CREATIONS</h1>
    <h2>WHAT'S THE APP?</h2>
    <p>The Review Creation app aims to provide feedback based on daily lives. People could follow other users (such as friends, family) and see the feedback made by them through this platform. The reviews are provided by an individual about a venue, area, hotel, restaurant, or movies etc. The main concept behind this is for a user to choose a place to visit or have dinner just
        by looking at the suggestions or reviews provided by anyone.  </p>
