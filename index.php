<br><br>
<p>The Review Creation app aims to provide feedback based on daily lives. People could follow other users (such as
    friends, family) and see the feedback made by them through this platform. The reviews are provided by an individual
    about a venue, area, hotel, restaurant, or movies etc. The main concept behind this is for a user to choose a place
    to visit or have dinner just
    by looking at the suggestions or reviews provided by anyone. </p>
